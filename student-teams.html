      <p>Memorial Relay For Life is a student team dedicated to fundraising to support the fight against cancer. As a tech team member, I was tasked with helping design the layout of the venue for our relay night where volunteers 
        walk laps around the Works track & field from 7pm to 7am. I also contributed to the fundraising events with the Memorial Relay Team. We were able to raise $98,400.96 in total.
        During our relay night, I provided AV solutions and solved tech related issues throughout the fundraiser.

      <p>Memorial Baja is a student design team focused on designing and building our own off-road vehicle and racing it against other university teams in competition. 
        As a software developer for the team, I was tasked with updating the frontend code, libraries and the vehicle's raspberry pi code for the vehicle's dash sensors, in order to display a dash sensor and speedometer
        on the off-road vehicle. I was also tasked with developing an implementation of  Web Sockets for the vehicle's new ESP32 transmission.

      <p><span class="one-line"><strong> Software Developer</strong> –  Eastern Edge Robotics • January 2024 - Present</span></p>
      <p>Eastern Edge Robotics is a student design team focused on designing and building our own underwater ROV which we use in competition against other university teams in the MATE ROV competition.
        As a software developer for the team, I contributed to the GUI's development and it's functionality to interact with user and ROV.
      </p>
      <p> I created webpages for settings, ROV commands, and thruster control, along with live ADC and
 Temperature sensors for the ROV that are displayed on the GUI and updated in real time. I've also created backend software for the joystick & thruster configuration using ROS2 and JSON in a Dockerized environment. This helped immensely since the joystick and thruster's could
 now be controlled remotely from the GUI. During the competition we were able to operate the ROV from the touch of a button.
 </p>
 <p> My latest task for the team has been the development of OpenCV software to scan data tables of invasive carp species and extract location data. after scanning and storing the data the program will animate the carp spread in the
 Illinois River based on temporal data visualization.
 </p>
 <p>I am also the electrical engineering presenter and representative for the MATE ROV World Competition where I will present all of the electrical design and implementation on the underwater ROV to a panel of judges followed by a Q&A panel.

      <p><span class="one-line"><strong>Engineering Lead / VP of Marketing</strong> – Memorial Enactus • February 2023 - Present</span></p>
      <p> Enactus Memorial is a student design team focused on designing business and products that create positive social and environmental impact. I am the team's Engineering Lead as well as the Vice President of Marketing.
       Our current projects are Project R3D-Reach which takes plastic pollution from our oceans and turns it into 3D printing filament which we use to create wristbands that display a patient's medical information for use in the Healthcare industry. Our second project is Equipped-2-Excel which is an 
       online learning platform focused on teaching soft skills and financial literacy to high school and university students.
 </p>
 <p>During my time on the team, I've worked on the design and development of the pultrusion device and 3D printing devices that will turn plastic pollution into 3D printing filament.
       I've worked on the design of the 3D printed wristbands from recycled plastic as well as implementing the wristband's security to ensure user confidentiality and privacy.
</p>
<p>      I'm also a presenter and Q&A member for the 2024 and 2025 Enactus Regional Competitions along with the 2024 and 2025 Enactus National Competition. During the 2024 Regional competiton, we placed first in the Regional Innovation and Impact challenge as well as the TD Entrepeneurship Challenge.
      Over the 2025 Regional Competition we placed first in the Innovation and Impact challenge as well as the Desjardins youth empowerment challenge.
      Over the 2024 National competition we were able to obtain third place in the national innovation and impact challenge as well as semi-finalists during the 2025 competition.
